Todo List App is a basic app for creating and managing tasks (todos) and lists.

## About the Project

The development started as a part of SuperSimpleDev's JS course (https://youtu.be/EerdGm-ehJQ?si=LKKU2fycqqzR1KFZ).

The first version of the app looked like this:

![First version of this project](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a44b9487-f5c7-4ea9-8720-fa6f1c87ca95)

At that time you could only add and delete items in a single list. LocalStorage was implemented too (if it even worth mentioning).

In the end of the course it was an exercise to implement multiple lists, but I got carried away, hand-crafted lots of components and learned a lot of things about vanilla Javascript.

The 3 technologies listed in the Tech Stack were all learned and practiced during the development too.
  
Besides that, even though I don't really consider myself a good designer, I also did my best to try and make the app look good so I'll include some screenshots in the next section.

## Note

The app was NOT made responsive nor fully accessible (no ARIA) for the reason that the only goal of this was just to practice my JS skills,
and achieving that goal already took too much time (taking in account that this is my **first** ever serious and finished project). 
Although it isn't that difficult so the app might get an adaptation for various devices, as well as accessibility improvements as soon as I have free time.
